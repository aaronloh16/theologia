Covenant theology asserts that prior to the Fall God made a covenant of works with Adam as the representative of all humankind.

According to federal theology, if Adam had been obedient to God, his obedience would have meant blessing for all humans. But because Adam was disobedient, the curse extends to humankind, of which Adam is the covenantal representative. Federal theology adds that just as Adam was the federal head of humanity, so also Christ enters history as a second Adam, free from the curse, and acts as the covenantal head of righteousness for all those who believe in him.",

In theology and biblical studies, feminism in its broadest sense has sought to show both God's feminine characteristics and how Scripture has often been interpreted with male biases and assumptions. In its most radical forms, theological feminism argues that God should be addressed with feminine titles (such as Goddess or Mother) and that many parts of the Bible, especially the OT, are at best patriarchal (and thus irrelevant) or at worst antiwoman (and thus oppressive to women). In more moderate forms, feminism seeks to provide feminine language and perspectives in theological reflection on God, while not abandoning the traditional titles of Father, Son and Spirit in reference to the *Trinity.",

One of Harnack's central arguments was that the development of doctrine, or *dogma, in the early church led away from the original teachings of Jesus and his disciples. Harnack argued, therefore, that the task of the theologian and church historian is to strip away the \"husk\" of cultural and historical developments of doctrine and get back to the original \"kernel\" of the gospel found in Jesus. For Harnack, this kernel was Jesus' announcement of the *kingdom of God. This kingdom is based in the Fatherhood of God and the kinship of humankind, and it is fulfilled by Christians through the exercise of higher righteousness (love).",

Many theologians see in the term a reference to Jesus' choice not to exercise the prerogatives and powers that were his by virtue of his divine nature. In the nineteenth century certain thinkers built this idea into a kenotic *Christology,which spoke of the incarnation as the self-emptying of the preexistent, eternal Son to become the human Jesus. This self-emptying involved the setting aside of certain divine attributes, or at least the independent exercise of his divine powers.",

Medieval theology was chiefly concerned with systematizing and organizing Christian truth as it had been developed by the leading thinkers of the *patristic era. This led eventually to the writing of the great theological treatises that encompassed the entire body of Christian teaching. The flowering of medieval theology came in the so-called high Middle Ages (the twelfth and thirteenth centuries), especially in the work of Thomas *Aquinas, such as in his *Summa Theologica (summary of theology).",

Philosophers and theologians have debated how time and eternity are related, as well as the nature of the connection between God and time. Some thinkers assert that time and eternity arc totally distinct, while others collapse them, in part as a reaction against viewing time as itself being an entity.

      "fullDefinition": "Latin for the \"way of eminence,\" the via eminentiae or via analogiae (way of analogy) refers to *Aquinas's analogical approach to the understanding of and language about God. Aquinas considered all speech about God analogous in that it uses finite images from creation that allow the theologian to make positive though inadequate affirmations of God. Through the via negativa \"negative\" statements (saying what God is not) are used to articulate the ineffability of God (e.g., incomprehensibility and infallibility). Aquinas's analogical predication depends on an interpretation of the doctrine of creation that sees all things as brought into being and sustained by God, who is the cause of the world, causality itself being an analogical notion. Thus the via causalitatus allows the theologian to predicate of God all that must be said about God as the first cause of the world.",
